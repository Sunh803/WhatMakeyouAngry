# WhatMakeyouAngry
WWDC2023
The self-reflection app designed for the iPhone 14 provides a tool for individuals to gain a better understanding of themselves and their emotions, ultimately leading to healthier expressions of anger. The app facilitates self-reflection and emotional organization by prompting users to specify the individual they are angry with, the level of anger, the emotions they are feeling, and the emotions they were experiencing before feeling angry. The app has the potential to improve anger management skills and reduce negative consequences of anger.
